# Statistics Time-Series Analysis using R
time series with R in statics class

This project focuses on analyzing time series data, which refers to the observed values of variables (e.g., stock prices, COVID-19 cases) changing over time. 
I learned about key statistical models for analyzing time series data and apply them to real-world datasets. The course covers perspectives on time series data in statistics, analysis models based on the presence of trends, testing for trends, volatility models, and models considering the correlation between multiple time series data. Emphasis is placed on understanding time series models from a statistical perspective, with a focus on the necessary mathematical concepts. Practical exercises will be conducted using the R programming language.
